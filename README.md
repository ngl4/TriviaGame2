### Reflection: 

Unlike the [first version](https://github.com/ngl4/TriviaGame) of this game, I did not think it is too challenging, but I was a little frustrated with the long length of the code. I have learned to use functions to organize repetitive codes and also to know sometimes it is better to have long codes that are easily readable.
